    <h1>Nothin' but Otters</h1>

    <p>this is an entire webpage dedicated to Otters (honestly its just a test but like pretend this looks cool).</p>


<p>Otters like to hold hands when they float, so they dont float away from each other.</p>

<p>Otters also like to use small rocks to crack open clams.</p>
